## Overview
### Description
This application is a Zoo Management System where you can enter the zoo as a visitor, employee or the owner. As a visitor, you can visit the 6 environment and interact with the animals. 

## Use Cases
Make Use Cases from Textual Descriptions 
Each Use Case focuses on a specific scenario, and describes the steps that are necessary to bring it to successful completion. Each step in a use case represents an interaction with people or entities outside the computer system (the actors) and the system itself. 

As per the textual description of the project, the actors in the use cases will be Humans, the Visitors, Owner, Employees.

## Design Patterns Applied
Iterator 
- To iterate the list of Employees to get the Sign In
- Check SignInEmployee.java to see how we loop through

Strategy 
- We have an interface AnimalActions.java
- Utilizes static methods to implement the 'STRATEGY' pattern
- Each animal object implements said interface and rewrites the methods

MVC Model View Controller 
- We separated the Model, View and the Controller
  - Model is where the data is
  - View, we used JavaFx to display the views and uses the Controller
  - Controller handles the input from the user and manipulates the data and view to update.

## Components
We have one file for all the implementation
We have another file for images
